This is the final project from [Codecademy's Intro to Data Analysis Pro Intensive] which focused on building real world skills in data analysis, data visualization, SQL, Git, and hypothesis testing. 

The course also included a capstone project involving an A/B Test for a hypothetical gym, MuscleHub. The capstone required analysis and a set of slides for a presentation.
